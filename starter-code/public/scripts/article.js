// REVIEW: We will be writing documentation today for the methods in this file that handles Model layer of our application. As an example, here is documentation for Article.prototype.toHtml(). You will provide documentation for the other methods in this file in the same structure as the following example. In addition, where there are TODO comment lines inside of the method, describe what the following code is doing (down to the next TODO) and change the TODO into a DONE when finished.

/**
 * OVERVIEW of Article.prototype.toHtml():
 * - A method on each instance that converts raw article data into HTML
 * - Inputs: nothing passed in; called on an instance of Article (this)
 * - Outputs: HTML of a rendered article template
 */
Article.prototype.toHtml = function() {
  // DONE: Retrieves the  article template from the DOM and passes the template as an argument to the Handlebars compile() method, with the resulting function being stored into a variable called 'template'.
  var template = Handlebars.compile($('#article-template').text());

  // DONE: Creates a property called 'daysAgo' on an Article instance and assigns to it the number value of the days between today and the date of article publication
  this.daysAgo = parseInt((new Date() - new Date(this.publishedOn))/60/60/24/1000);

  // DONE: Creates a property called 'publishStatus' that will hold one of two possible values: if the article has been published (as indicated by the check box in the form in new.html), it will be the number of days since publication as calculated in the prior line; if the article has not been published and is still a draft, it will set the value of 'publishStatus' to the string '(draft)'
  this.publishStatus = this.publishedOn ? `published ${this.daysAgo} days ago` : '(draft)';

  // DONE: Assigns into this.body the output of calling marked() on this.body, which converts any Markdown formatted text into HTML, and allows existing HTML to pass through unchanged
  this.body = marked(this.body);

// DONE: Output of this method: the instance of Article is passed through the template() function to convert the raw data, whether from a data file or from the input form, into the article template HTML
  return template(this);
